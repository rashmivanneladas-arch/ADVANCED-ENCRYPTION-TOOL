Advanced Encryption Tool - CODTECH Internship Project

🔐 AES-256 File Encryption & Decryption Application

This Python-based encryption tool was developed as part of the CODTECH Internship Program (Task #4) to provide robust file security through military-grade encryption. The application implements AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of protected files.

Key Features:

· Military-Grade Security: Implements AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by governments and security agencies worldwide
· Password Protection: Utilizes PBKDF2 for secure key derivation from user passwords with salt-based hashing
· User-Friendly Interface: Command-line menu system with intuitive options for encryption and decryption
· File Format Support: Encrypts any file type including documents, images, PDFs, and archives
· Security Best Practices: Implements proper nonce/IV generation, authenticated encryption, and tamper detection

Technical Implementation:
Built with Python and PyCryptodome library, this tool follows security best practices including secure random number generation for initialization vectors, password confirmation mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling. The modular architecture separates encryption logic, file operations, and user interface components for maintainability and extensibility.

Use Cases:
· Secure sensitive documents before cloud storage
· Protect confidential business files
· Safeguard personal information on shared systems
· Educational tool for understanding encryption principles

Project Context:
Completed as Task #4 of the CODTECH Internship Program, this project demonstrates practical application of cryptographic principles, Python development skills, and secure software implementation. The repository includes complete source code, documentation, examples, and testing instructions.

Technologies: Python 3, PyCryptodome, AES-256, PBKDF2, GCM Mode
Category: Cybersecurity, Cryptography, File Security
Status: Production-ready, actively maintained.
